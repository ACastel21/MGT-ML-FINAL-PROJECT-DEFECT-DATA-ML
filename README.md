# MGT-ML-FINAL-PROJECT-DEFECT-DATA-ML
MGT 665 ML Final Project- Predicting Manufacturing defects using various models- Castel, Andrey and O'Dell, James

#  MGT 665 Final Project

##  Objective
Analyze a manufacturing defect dataset using advanced machine learning to:
- Predict defect severity using decision trees & random forests
- Identify association rules via Apriori
- Recommend operational improvements from defect patterns

##  ML Techniques Used
- **Decision Trees**: interpretable models for defect cause analysis
- **Random Forests**: robust, high-accuracy classifier with feature importance
- **Apriori Algorithm**: reveals frequent defect combinations
- **K-means**: clusters defect types or timestamps
- **• Data was retrieved using KaggleHub and includes simulated manufacturing defect entries.
- **• Visualizations and analysis were performed using tools such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Missingno.


##  Visuals
All visuals are stored in `visuals/`:
- Feature importances
- Confusion matrices
- Association rule heatmaps

##  Media
Multimedia walkthroughs can be found in `media/`:
- `PLACEHOLDERFORPRESENTATIONSLIDES.pptx`: Project overview & findings
- `PLACEHOLDERFORSCREENRECORDING.mp4`: Screen recording of code + narration
- `PLACEHOLDERFORAUDIO.mp3`: Audio explanation of logic

## Summary
This project explores how clustering, classification, and pattern discovery techniques can be applied to improve insights into manufacturing defects, helping identify trends and support quality control decisions.
