MGT 665 ML Final Project- Predicting Manufacturing defects using various models- Castel, Andrey and O'Dell, James

#  MGT 665 Final Project

##  Objective
Analyze a manufacturing defect dataset using advanced machine learning to:
- Predict defect severity using decision trees & random forests
- Identify association rules via Apriori
- Recommend operational improvements from defect patterns

##  ML Techniques Used
- **Decision Trees**: interpretable models for defect cause analysis
- **Random Forests**: robust, high-accuracy classifier with feature importance
- **Apriori Algorithm**: reveals frequent defect combinations
- **K-means**: clusters defect types or timestamps
- **• Data was retrieved using KaggleHub and includes simulated manufacturing defect entries.
- **• Visualizations and analysis were performed using tools such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Missingno.

## Summary
This project explores how clustering, classification, and pattern discovery techniques can be applied to improve insights into manufacturing defects, helping identify trends and support quality control decisions.
